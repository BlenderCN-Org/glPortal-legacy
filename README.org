* About
GlPortal is a puzzle game inspired by Valves Portal 
originaly written by Simon Larsen. The source code needs a lot
of cleaning up. 
That is why GlPortal is an ideal candidate to practice code 
refactoring.

In case the source of GlPortal is to cryptic for you, consider 
contributing to GlPortal2 a try to write a similar game from 
scratch.

If you need to talk directly to me (everything that is no bug report,
feature request or question that fits in the public discussion)
you can contact me at portal at w3-net.de by email.

* What is happening with the code right now
I am currently migrating methods from the cluttered main class.
To get the methods to another class without breaking functionality
I am writing helper methods to inject all dependencies from the main class into the game class. 
These helper methods will be removed once all the code is properly migrated.
* Compile the source
- cmake src
- make
* Join the team
You can join the community at http://social.w3-net.de/groups/glportal/ 
for questions and discussions about the development of the game.
A makeshift Issue tracker can be found at 
https://github.com/hhirsch/glPortal/issues .

Please send me a pull request on github if you have changes.

* GlPortal2
If you need a clean start, GlPortal2 might be what you are looking 
for. GlPortal2 tries to archive the same kind of game while sticking 
to design principles and a more strict approach to producing clean
code from the beginning. You can find the repository of GlPortal2 at 
https://github.com/hhirsch/glPortal2/ .
