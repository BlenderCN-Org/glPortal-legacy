* What is happening with the code right now
I am currently migrating methods from the cluttered main class.
To get the methods to another class without breaking functionality
I am writing helper methods to inject all dependencies from the main class into the game class. 
These helper methods will be removed once all the code is properly migrated.
* Compile the source
- cmake src
- make
